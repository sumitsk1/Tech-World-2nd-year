					<div class="art_des">
						When all you want to do is make the world more open and connected, but you end up building a surveillance architecture that allows a foreign power to subvert U.S. democracy, well, then you done screwed up. Either that, or it was about money and control all along. 
						Mark Zuckerberg’s company played a vital role in the dissemination of so-called fake news leading up to the 2016 election. Facebook's culpability in the sordid affair was painstakingly brought to light in story after story published over the last 12 months.

					<div class="art_des">
						Weaponized NSA exploits, ransomware freezing hospital computers, leaked Game of Thrones scripts, and hackers stealing the personal data of potentially 143 million Americans — all in all, 2017 was a bad year for cybersecurity. 
						WannaCry, a particularly virulent form of ransomware, spread around the globe with lightening speed and was only stopped by chance when a 22-year-old security researcher by the name of Marcus Hutchins managed to find and implement a so-called kill switch.

					<div class="art_des">
						This was the year self-driving cars became real. Sure, various forms of the tech existed before 2017, but over the course of the last 12 months we saw supposedly fully autonomous vehicles actually hit the streets of a major U.S. city with no driver behind the wheel. That is a big deal.
						Tesla, of course, has grabbed headlines with its Model S, Semi, and new Roadster, but when it comes to autonomous tech, Waymo, Uber, and Lyft are all nipping at the company's heels.

					<div class="art_title"><h3>4. The disappearing phone</h3></div>
					<div class="art_des">
						Say goodbye to the bezel. Over the course of 2017, companies like Apple and Samsung proved that nearly bezel-less phones are now the norm. The iPhone X is perhaps the most notable example of this, with an abandonment of the phone's chin and an embrace of the notch. 
						This past year kicked off a race toward phones that are all screen, and coming models will likely push this trend even further.
